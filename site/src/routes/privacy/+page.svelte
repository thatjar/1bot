<h1>1Bot Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Privacy is an inalienable human right, and we respect it.</h2>
<p>
  As for this website, it collects absolutely no data from you. <br />
  As for 1Bot itself, it does not have any Privileged Gateway Intents (which include
  the Message Content intent) and is technically incapable of reading any messages
  in any Discord server unless it @mentions 1Bot. It is technically capable of reading
  direct messages to it, but it does not do so. Only a minimal amount of data is
  collected in specific cases to keep 1Bot reliable - read the next section for more.
</p>

<h2>The only data we collect</h2>
<p>
  When you use any of 1Bot's commands, it does not log or store anything unless
  the command results in an unexpected error. In case of an unhandled error,
  1Bot may log any or all of the following piece of information:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The command name</li>
  <li>Any parameters you include in it</li>
  <li>
    Whether the command was invoked via user integration or server integration
  </li>
  <li>Whether the command was invoked in a server or not</li>
  <li>Your Discord user ID</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This information is collected purely to improve the reliability and
  functionality of the bot, and ensure that the user who invokes the command in
  question is not a malicious actor who may be attempting to rate-limit the bot
  from Discord.
</p>

<p>
  For some commands that connect to third parties, the data you include in the
  command parameters may be sent to the third party. We are not responsible for
  how these third parties handle your data.

  or this website for yourself.
